              Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with
              the study, design and application of equipment, devices and
              systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.

            <p>Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to explain the birth, 
           life and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe. 
           It has two sibling sciences, astronomy and cosmology, and the lines between them blur.</p>

              Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, 
              molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they 
              undergo during a reaction with other substances.
